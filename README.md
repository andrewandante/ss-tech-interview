## Silverstripe Ltd Technical Test

## Installation

`composer install`

A `Vagrantfile.dist` is provided to assist with your local set up, but please
set up however you'd like.

A small `ss_tech_test.sql` file is included that you should import in
order to get you started.

See [the "Getting Started" section on the docs site](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/getting_started/)
for more information if you are having trouble setting up.

## What do I do with this?

This test is designed to mirror the workflow that someone in the SilverHawks
team might be expected to handle on a daily basis. We end up working on a
mix of bug fixes and new features.

This is a _very_ minimal site that has a single custom page type that allows
a candidate to submit a form to apply for a job with us! However, we've just
inherited this site from Not-Very-Good-Dev-Agency and the client has asked
us to fix it up.

We'd like you to fork this repository and work through the tickets the client
has raised, and share it with us before your technical interview so we can
check what you've done.

You will see the [list of Bugs and Features as Github Issues](https://github.com/andrewandante/ss-tech-interview/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)

Please [start at #1](https://github.com/andrewandante/ss-tech-interview/issues/1)
and move through them in order, getting as many done as you can.

**Each ticket assumes you have completed the previous one, so bear that in mind**
